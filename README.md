# Treasure-Hunt

## Objectives

I created a C language program and ran it using user-defined data types (structures). I've been working on programming a short game with treasure and bombs concealed along a path with varying lengths. To expose what is concealed at a certain spot along the journey, the player must execute move location commands. The goal of the game is to uncover as many treasures as you can before your movements or lives run out. The player's life total will decrease after finding a bomb. The player will receive treasure points for finding a treasure. The player will lose lives and receive treasure points if they find both a treasure and a bomb in the same area (consider it a life insurance payout). Prior to playing the game, the program will prompt the user to perform some upfront configurations to the player and the game components – these settings will define how the game is played.
